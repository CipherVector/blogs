Hi, 
This is my first newsletter and will be the start of the archive. Since this letter will lay on deaf ears. Here is my OP-ED on The silicon crisis.
The Chip shortage crisis and its implications on global supply chains and the most vulnerable.
From geopolitics to ease of life, semiconductors are deeply important for global stability and the continuation of modern day endulgements. 

Let's start off with introducing a microchip.  A very high level explanation is that just like the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, to the similar extent the microchip is the same. It does mathematical calculations which allow for your technology to do things as simple as telling time but  to more advanced functions like 3d graphics and linear algebra. 

Now given this, it takes a couple of leaps to get to the implications for the world, and to realise the harshest hit by the rising prices are the people least able to take it. Technology has brought rise to ever growing quality of living standards being able to uplift countries in total poverty to global superpowers. For example, take Nigeria's growing number of tech entrepreneurs who have started numerous startups. The biggest being MTN NIGERIA, which is a telecommunications company. This shows the deep rooted necessity technology  provides in which it comes to the point that the second largest company in the country with a GDP of 432.3 Billion is a telecommunications company. But it doesn’t stop there. Everyday we read stories about people in lec (Lesser economically developed countries) educating themselves using the internet to learn new skills which allow them to lift themselves out of poverty. This displays a sort of tech altruism where the poorest of the poor are able to lift themselves into a reasonable standard of living solely off free information found on the internet. Although with the global chip shortage low cost electronics are growing in cost with the components increasing on average 10%- 40 % this means that with these low margin low cost electronics the cost will have to be passed down to consumers in the form of increased prices. And with the cost of these goods already being extremely high to people on or around the poverty line an increase as low as 10% could mean the difference to being able to barely afford the item to it never being feasible. However you may consider that most of the electronics impoverished people have access to are used goods which may not directly be affected by increased prices of components. Nevertheless used goods will still see an increase in cost as the value of recycling these devices increases meaning that the likelihood that these items will be sold to recyclers rather than be used will increase as a it is fair assumption that a majority of people around the poverty line would prefer the extra cash to be able to purchase goods rather than a device which will not lead to direct immediate improvements to quality of life. As the ability for foresight is one only afforded to people with the wealth to wait.

The importance doesn’t stop with the impacts for the poorest of the global population, the semiconductor industry is also plagued with a big problem: its reliance on taiwan.

TSMC is responsible for over 50% of global semiconductor production and with it being based inside of Taiwan this shows the great importance of ensuring the stability of the region for western countries. If China were to invade Taiwan this could spell doom for our modern endulgements. We wouldn't for instance see just a 50% increase in semiconductor prices but would more likely see an exponential increase in the cost of these semiconductors as it would be physically impossible for any of these manufacturers  to increase their production to anywhere close to the void that a removed tsmc would create. This means that again the poorest would be impacted even harsher. Additionally the impacts wouldn’t end there. With the ever growing rise in our reliance on microchips and semiconductors, the motivation for a full scale invasion of Taiwan grows more and more likely. Given the deep-seated animosity between the two countries. The government of china wants to invade china but the economic cost aren’t viable, but with the increasing reliance of companies such as TSMC the justification of war because more and more easy as  the invasion of taiwan would spell at best chinese control over tsmc and hence a greater reliance on china from the west. And at worst the total destruction of tsmc and an astronomical and almost impossible supply chain and logistical situation for western companies increasing china's dominance. This issue is very clear to many western countries hence the rationale between them promising military support and aid in the case of an invasion but this definitely doesn’t make this a none issue.

The final issue I would like to address is the implications of the semiconductor/microchip shortage in the west. Even though a western countries are insulated from a majority of these issues, that doesn’t remain true for them all. As stated previously many car manufacturers have been forced to delay production and some even removing features from cars. It's clear that manufactures aren’t able to produce enough to meet customer demand for instance Nvidia 30 series gpus which have seen an around the bored 25% increase in their msrp price. 

In a way we are lucky, even though the effects have been bad it could've been worse.The shortages weren’t on the extreme for example an invasion of taiwan and tsmcs ability to produce. This shortage has given many companies and countries a wakeup call towards the importance of securing supply chains and luckily wasn’t a total collapse. This means that many corporations such as tsmc have the ability to learn from their mistakes and come back stronger and better able to harden themselves against shortages from happening and affecting their supply chains. An example of this could be the commencement of talks for tsmc to build a factory within the united states to diversify its production locations and remove the risk of geopolitical instability from the companies ability to produce microchips.
