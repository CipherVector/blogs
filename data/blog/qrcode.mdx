How UWC manadges cups?
---
UWC has reusable cups, which get filled with drinks that students pay for. After they are done these drinks get brought to centralized return stations to be collected at the end of the day. The issues many students don't end up returning the cups and the cups get lost.

---
So here is the outline of my soloution.
---
 The project uses a firebase backend, to manadge who has which cup. We use a sort of libary check in, and checkout. To checkin we use a raspberry pi located at purchase kiosk, which uses a camera to scan the student id every student has and a qr code placed on the bottom of a reusable cup. And to check the cups back in we will scan them in when they are being washed.
